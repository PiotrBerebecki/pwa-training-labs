//Promise.all returns a promise that resolves if all of the promises passed into it resolve.
//If any of the passed-in promises reject, then Promise.all rejects with the reason of the first promise
//that rejected.
//This is very useful for ensuring that a group of asynchronous actions complete before proceeding to
//another step.
//Note: Even if an promise rejects, causing Promise.all to reject, the remaining promises
//still settle.In other words, the remaining promises still execute, they simply are not returned
//by Promise.all.
